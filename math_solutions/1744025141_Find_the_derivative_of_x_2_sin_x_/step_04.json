The chain rule states that if f(g(x)) = h(x), then its derivative is given by:\n\nh'(x) = (dg/dx)(g(x))\n\nIn this case, let's apply the chain rule to find the derivative of sin(x). We know that:\n\nsin'(\u03b8) = cos(\u03b8)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is any angle. Now, we can substitute g(x) for x in our expression above:\n\ng(x) = sin(x)\ndg/dx = d(sin(x))/dx = cos(x)\n\nSo, using the chain rule, we get:\n\ng'(x) = (cos(x))(d(sin(x))/dx) = cos^2(x)\n\n**",
